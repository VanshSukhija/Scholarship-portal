	Hissar district, also called Hissar, has an area of 3,983 square kilometres and its population is 15,36,417. The district headquarters is situated in Hissar town. Hissar is one of the important districts of Haryana, if viewed from a political angle. Other smaller towns are Hansi, Uklana, Adampur Agroha and Barwala.

	Hissar town was one of the prime centres of Harappan culture. The area has been associated with ancient Vedic tribes such as Bharatas, Puius, Kurus, Mujavatas and Mahavrishas. During medieval times, it went through upheavals and conquests and gained importance for its strategic location with regard to Delhi.

	Feroze Shah Tughlaq constructed a fort here and called it Hissar-e-Firoza (the Fort of Feroze) and dug canals from the Yamuna and Ghaggar rivers to irrigate the dry land. It is a grand structure, has a basement and a mosque. He built a mosque called Lat ke Masjid Humayun built a Masjid at Fatehabad near Hissar town. Emperor Akbar made Hissar the headquarters of the district, which was earlier controlled by Feroze Shah. During the early nineteenth century, the British took Hissar under their charge along with the rest of Haryana.</p>
