# Scholarship-portal
This is a project made by the 6 members of Kasukabe Defense Group namely Dev Mahajan, Shantanu, Vansh Sukhija, Tanisha Garg, Anupma Yadav, Garvit Mukhija for the SIH Hackathon. <br>
We have tried to make a portal where students can register and get information about the various national and international scholarships. <br>
We have used HTML, CSS, Javascript and Firebase real-time database management in which data can be inserted/updated/deleted using HTML page and can be displayed on other HTML page which updates in real time.
